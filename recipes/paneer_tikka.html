    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Prepare the Paneer and Marinade</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Paneer:</strong> Cut the paneer into 1.5-inch cubes. If using store-bought paneer, make sure it's firm and well-drained.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix the Marinade:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the thick yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, cumin powder, kasuri methi, chickpea flour, vegetable oil (or melted butter), and salt. Whisk everything together until smooth.</li>
                <li><strong>Marinate the Paneer:</strong> Add the paneer cubes into the marinade and gently coat them. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours (overnight is even better for deeper flavor).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Grill the Paneer</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat the Grill/Oven:</strong> If you’re using a grill or oven, preheat it to 200°C (400°F). Alternatively, you can also make paneer tikka on a stovetop using a griddle (tawa).</li>
                <li><strong>Thread the Paneer (optional):</strong> If using a skewer, thread the marinated paneer cubes onto the skewers. You can alternate with sliced onions and bell peppers for extra flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Grilling (Oven or Grill):</strong> Place the skewers or paneer cubes directly on the grill or baking tray lined with parchment paper. Brush the paneer with oil or butter. Grill for about 15-20 minutes, turning the skewers halfway through, until the paneer is golden brown with slight charring. You can baste it with more oil or butter during grilling for a rich flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Stovetop Griddle:</strong> Heat a non-stick or cast iron griddle (tawa) on medium heat. Add a little oil and place the marinated paneer pieces. Cook each side for 2-3 minutes until golden brown and slightly crisp.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Serve</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Once grilled, remove the paneer from the skewers (if using) and place them on a serving platter.</li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves, onion rings, and lemon wedges.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with a side of mint chutney or tamarind chutney.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
