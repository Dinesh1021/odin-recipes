    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Step 1: Prepare the Bhaji (Vegetable Curry)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil the Vegetables:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>In a large pot, add the chopped potatoes, carrots, peas, and a pinch of salt. Add water and cook until the vegetables are soft and tender (about 10-15 minutes). You can use a pressure cooker to speed this up, cooking for 2-3 whistles.</li>
                    <li>Once cooked, drain the water (but keep a little aside) and mash the vegetables using a potato masher. Set aside.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Base:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan or skillet over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add cumin seeds and let them splutter for a few seconds.</li>
                    <li>Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and chopped green chilies. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Vegetables:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and green bell pepper to the pan. Sauté until the tomatoes soften and the oil starts to separate from the masala (about 5-7 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, pav bhaji masala, and garam masala powder. Stir everything together and cook for a minute until the spices are well-mixed and aromatic.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mash and Combine:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Add the boiled and mashed vegetables to the pan. Mix well with the masala base.</li>
                    <li>Add 1-2 tablespoons of water to get the desired consistency. The bhaji should be soft but not too runny.</li>
                    <li>Adjust the salt and spice levels according to taste. Let the bhaji simmer on low heat for 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend together.</li>
                    <li>Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice and garnish with chopped coriander leaves.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <li><h3>Step 2: Prepare the Pav (Bread Rolls)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Toast the Pav:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Heat a tawa (griddle) or non-stick pan over medium heat.</li>
                        <li>Slice the pav rolls horizontally (keeping them intact from one side).</li>
                        <li>Add a little butter on the pan and place the pav slices on it. Toast the pav until golden brown and crispy on both sides. You can add a bit more butter for extra flavor.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li><h3>Step 3: Serve</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Serve the hot bhaji in a bowl, garnished with fresh coriander leaves, and a dollop of butter on top.</li>
                <li>Serve with the toasted pav on the side</li>
                <li>Optionally, add a wedge of lemon and some finely chopped onions for garnish and a fresh crunch.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
