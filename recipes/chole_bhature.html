        <li><h3>Step 1:Prepare the Chole (Chickpea Curry)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Soak the chickpeas:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>If using dried chickpeas, soak them in plenty of water for 8-10 hours or overnight. After soaking, drain the water.</li>
                        <li>If using canned chickpeas, simply drain and rinse them under cold water.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cook the Chickpeas:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>In a pressure cooker, add the soaked chickpeas with enough water (about 3 cups). Optionally, add 1-2 tea bags tied in a muslin cloth or a small pouch to give the chole a dark color (this step is optional).</li>
                        <li>Pressure cook for about 4-5 whistles or until the chickpeas are soft and tender. Set aside.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Masala:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of ghee or oil in a large pan over medium heat.</li>
                        <li>Add cumin seeds, bay leaf, and black cardamoms. Let them splutter for a few seconds.</li>
                        <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
                        <li>Add ginger, garlic, and green chilies. Sauté for another minute.</li>
                        <li>Now, add the pureed tomatoes (or chopped tomatoes) and cook until the oil begins to separate from the masala (around 7-8 minutes).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Spice it Up:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Add the coriander powder, cumin powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, amchur powder, and kasuri methi. Cook for a minute until the spices are well-blended and aromatic.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Add the Cooked Chickpeas:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Add the cooked chickpeas (without the tea bags, if used) to the masala. Stir well and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add 1-1.5 cups of water (adjust according to the consistency you prefer for the curry). Bring to a boil and then let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add garam masala and salt. Adjust the seasoning as needed.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Simmer and Garnish:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Let the chole cook for another 5 minutes to blend the flavors. If you want a thicker gravy, mash a few chickpeas with the back of a spoon.</li>
                        <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li><h3>Step 2: Prepare the Bhature (Fried Bread)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina, baking soda, sugar, and salt.</li>
                        <li>Add yogurt, oil (or ghee), and start mixing. Gradually add warm water and knead the dough into a smooth, soft, and elastic consistency. The dough should not be too sticky or too firm.</li>
                        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 1 hour. The dough should rise slightly.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Shape the Bhature:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>After the dough has rested, divide it into small balls (about 8-10 balls, depending on the size you want for your bhature).</li>
                        <li>Roll each ball into a smooth, slightly thick oval or round shape using a rolling pin. Keep the surface lightly floured to prevent sticking.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Fry the Bhature:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. To check if the oil is hot enough, drop a small piece of dough into the oil. If it rises immediately, the oil is ready.</li>
                        <li>Fry each bhatura by gently sliding it into the hot oil. Press the bhatura lightly with a slotted spoon to help it puff up. Flip it once it’s golden brown and cook until both sides are crisp and golden.</li>
                        <li>Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li><h3>Step 3: Serve</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Serve the hot Chole alongside freshly made Bhature.</li>
                <li>Garnish with chopped onions, coriander leaves, and a squeeze of lemon.</li>
                <li>Enjoy with pickle, yogurt, or raita on the side.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
